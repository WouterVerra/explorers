The explore function takes my most used functions when exploring a new dataframe and lists the output from 1 command. 

The NAcol function is another exploratory function which finds how many NA values are present in every column of a dataframe. 

The NArow function is also an exploratory function that finds how many NA values are present in every row of a dataframe. 

The last function of this package is the replace function which replaces an old value to a new value inside of a specified column of a dataframe.
